A small bash script to pull printer usage per tray for HP P3010/P3015 P4515 P3005 4250 4015

requires a file in the same directory called printerip - it should contain a list of printer IP addresses on a new line.
snmpwalk also needs to be installed on the system running the script.

data is pulled via SNMP using the default public community.
